# Lab-3-Software-Project-Displaying Shapes

EECS 3311 - Software Design

My first software project for EECS 3311 A

The software projectâ€™s goal is to create an application that shows an interface with two buttons. Upon clicking the first button the application loads 6 shapes (circles, squares or rectangles) and the second button sorts these shapes based on their surfaces.
